# Covid-19-Visualization
Python and Data Science project thatâ€™s all about analyzing and visualizing current COVID-19 data. I focused on building 4 complete charts that will analyze both Worldwide trends and insights from Malawi. I analyze a CSV with Pandas, manipulate columns and apply various Pandas functions,  and then visualize the results through line charts, stacked bar charts and pie charts with MatPlotLib.
